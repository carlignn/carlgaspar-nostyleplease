      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got failing SSDs for a year now since I started my HOMELAB journey. It is all a Samsung 870 EVO 1TB SSD. I&amp;rsquo;ve bought 8 in total - 5 have failed and 3 more waiting for their demise.&#xA;I was blaming my Windows installation since it&amp;rsquo;s too heavy than the linux installations that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing so far. I never tried to install Windows again because of that. Then when I was trying to passthrough my GPU, then whatever homelab stuff that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.</description>

      <description>Yeah, this is not it. You&amp;rsquo;re telling me I need to have my cookies in it to be able to archive a private post? That&amp;rsquo;s too much work. I wish there&amp;rsquo;s a way around it. For the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ll just save my websites on a bookmark and on to the app itself (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.)&#xA;This definitely looks better than Karakeep but there&amp;rsquo;s no folder management. Therefore, this is not the solution for me just like PaperlessNGX.</description>

      <description>I have installed Cockpit in an LXC inside Proxmox. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good program, it&amp;rsquo;s just not the right one for my use case. Proxmox already has a good GUI for servers and I no longer see any use for this one.</description>

      <description>I DID IT! Finally reached Divine rank (4600 mmr) in DotA 2! I just want to prove to myself that I understand the mechanics of the game and I&amp;rsquo;m still capable of solving problems. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing this game on and off even before my age reached double digits.&#xA;First I tried to reach 3000 mmr (tiered rank does not exist yet at that time) from 2000 mmr then I stopped for 8 years.</description>

      <description>About a month ago, I had my ACL reconstructed and will not be able to play basketball for a year. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to just not do anything and standby, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to volunteer as the commissioner on the next league, and so that the owner of the league - the original commissioner can play the game.&#xA;Broken Shotclock As the commissioner, aside from managing things, in the court - I am the camera man.</description>

I followed this guy&amp;rsquo;s guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czx6LUnG1cs W-1 Surgery day I was put to mild sleep, then after an hour, it&amp;rsquo;s done, good shit! I feel weird that everything is okay, I can do ankle pumps but not quad sets but nothing hurts, I was waiting in a room and feel like I can go out and pee by myself.</description>

      <description>For this project, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen options between Discord, SMS, and email. I ended up with email as it seems like it&amp;rsquo;s the best for my use case: open industry standard, has been around forever, and isn&amp;rsquo;t going anywhere.&#xA;Problem The guides are only set for Gmail. Why? They already offer a standard SMTP interface. I use ProtonMail - and they don&amp;rsquo;t.&#xA;Fix I&amp;rsquo;ve done my research and here are the options that I found:</description>

      <description>Question This question has popped to my head after looking at my todolist. It goes something like this:&#xA;💅 Cut the nails&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve set this task so that I have a reminder to cut them once they reach a specific length. This has become a problem because I play a lot of basketball and longer nails than usual means something will change in my shot. The chances of it going in will be smaller than usual (not skill issue btw).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m worried about the state of my digital memories and personal data after seeing a lot of people failed by their NAS. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about putting this existing one onto my parents house as an offsite backup and build a new one that I can rack to save space. I thought that was a good idea but at the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s really expensive, so I&amp;rsquo;ve just decided (maybe for the meantime, until I can find another reason to build a new computer LOL) to put the backup in the cloud.</description>

Here are my requirements:&#xA;Supports Frigate High quality - atleast 4mp With POE - so that there are less wires and no more trouble of looking for the nearest power outlet Lightweight - I need it to be as light as possible because I can&amp;rsquo;t drill in my current place so I have to stick it on the ceiling.</description>

      <description>Hardware I have no choice but to buy a new hardware because we moved to a new place, therefore the internet has changed too - for the worse. Just like before, it has the option to configure subnet but it&amp;rsquo;s not working!&#xA;My options were the NanoPI R5S router, Gl.inet stuff, then this one - the Lenovo m720q - the best mini PC that you could get for cheap.&#xA;I chose this one because of the upgradability and aesthetics, and the price difference is also not that high so might as well settle for the one that pleases my eyes the most.</description>

      <description>First posted on: 2021-11-30T00:00:00+08:00&#xA;Introduction Valorant is a free-to play 5 versus 5 FPS (first-person tactical hero shooter) game developed and published by Riot Games on 2020. Simply put, it&amp;rsquo;s like CS:GO but with abilities.&#xA;I played this game because I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to play at that time, the system requirements is pretty low, and my computer can easily handle it. It is not my first FPS game but I can confidently say that it is the first FPS game that I seriously played.</description>

      <description>Threat Modeling, The What, Why, Who And When What Is Threat Modeling Threat Modeling is a process of systematically listing all potential ways one can attack an application.&#xA;Systematic approach - repeatable and consistent process during the whole development lifecycle Looking at attacks - actively looking at what can be abused Probable threat scenarios - list of threats Definitions Weakness - software defect, bug Vulnerability - weakness that can be exploited Attack/Incident - target, attack vector, threat actor Attack surface - anything that can be obtained, used, or attacked by a threat actor Risk = Impact * Likelihood Why Should One Perform Threat Modeling Pro-active approach - security upfront Efficient - the sooner a bug or a vulnerability is discovered in the SDLC, the cheaper it is Prioritize bugs - the outcome is the list of potential threats and/or risks of the application, which is used to determine further mitigation strategies that will allow to prioritize the workload Better understanding - will give the developers a whole overview of the system The ultimate objective of threat modeling is risk reduction.</description>
