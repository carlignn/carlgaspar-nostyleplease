      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to coach and train players of our league just to try and see what it feels like. I want to raise the floor of the league. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the trainee side since I was a kid, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to be the trainer. Here&amp;rsquo;s how the program will look in 2 hours time.&#xA;Training A Warmup - estimated time 2 mins Jumping jacks (25x) Cardio - estimated time 20 mins Jog - full length of court - lateral - backward - lateral (5x) Add sprint if there&amp;rsquo;s time or farming rice - 5 people, loser repeat Water break for winners</description>
