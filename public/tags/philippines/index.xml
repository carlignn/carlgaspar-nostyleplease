      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we were young, there are times in our studies where there are topics or lessons that our brain can&amp;rsquo;t comprehend. In this blog, I will discuss what I learned reviewing the really important topic - The Philippine Government. I learned that it is all based on the Philippine Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Philippine Government (Filipino: Pamahalaan ng Pilipinas) is the national government of the Philippines. It is governed as unitary state under a presidential representative and democratic and a constitutional republic where the President function as both the head of state and the head of government of the country within a multiform multi-party system. The government has three (3) interdependent branches: the &lt;strong&gt;legislative&lt;/strong&gt; branch, the &lt;strong&gt;executive&lt;/strong&gt; branch and the &lt;strong&gt;judicial&lt;/strong&gt; branch. The powers of the branches are vested by the Constitution of the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
