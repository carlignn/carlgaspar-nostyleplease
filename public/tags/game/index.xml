      <description>I DID IT! Finally reached Divine rank (4600 mmr) in DotA 2! I just want to prove to myself that I understand the mechanics of the game and I&amp;rsquo;m still capable of solving problems. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing this game on and off even before my age reached double digits.&#xA;First I tried to reach 3000 mmr (tiered rank does not exist yet at that time) from 2000 mmr then I stopped for 8 years.</description>

      <description>First posted on: 2021-11-30T00:00:00+08:00&#xA;Introduction Valorant is a free-to play 5 versus 5 FPS (first-person tactical hero shooter) game developed and published by Riot Games on 2020. Simply put, it&amp;rsquo;s like CS:GO but with abilities.&#xA;I played this game because I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to play at that time, the system requirements is pretty low, and my computer can easily handle it. It is not my first FPS game but I can confidently say that it is the first FPS game that I seriously played.</description>
