      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got failing SSDs for a year now since I started my HOMELAB journey. It is all a Samsung 870 EVO 1TB SSD. I&amp;rsquo;ve bought 8 in total - 5 have failed and 3 more waiting for their demise.&#xA;I was blaming my Windows installation since it&amp;rsquo;s too heavy than the linux installations that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing so far. I never tried to install Windows again because of that. Then when I was trying to passthrough my GPU, then whatever homelab stuff that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.</description>

      <description>Yeah, this is not it. You&amp;rsquo;re telling me I need to have my cookies in it to be able to archive a private post? That&amp;rsquo;s too much work. I wish there&amp;rsquo;s a way around it. For the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ll just save my websites on a bookmark and on to the app itself (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.)&#xA;This definitely looks better than Karakeep but there&amp;rsquo;s no folder management. Therefore, this is not the solution for me just like PaperlessNGX.</description>

      <description>I have installed Cockpit in an LXC inside Proxmox. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good program, it&amp;rsquo;s just not the right one for my use case. Proxmox already has a good GUI for servers and I no longer see any use for this one.</description>

      <description>I DID IT! Finally reached Divine rank (4600 mmr) in DotA 2! I just want to prove to myself that I understand the mechanics of the game and I&amp;rsquo;m still capable of solving problems. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing this game on and off even before my age reached double digits.&#xA;First I tried to reach 3000 mmr (tiered rank does not exist yet at that time) from 2000 mmr then I stopped for 8 years.</description>

      <description>About a month ago, I had my ACL reconstructed and will not be able to play basketball for a year. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to just not do anything and standby, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to volunteer as the commissioner on the next league, and so that the owner of the league - the original commissioner can play the game.&#xA;Broken Shotclock As the commissioner, aside from managing things, in the court - I am the camera man.</description>

      <description>Title Note Week/Day Date I am going for prehab to strengthen my muscles prior to operation. W-2 I am now doing all the exercises by myself everyday prior to operation. I followed this guy&amp;rsquo;s guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czx6LUnG1cs W-1 Surgery day I was put to mild sleep, then after an hour, it&amp;rsquo;s done, good shit! I feel weird that everything is okay, I can do ankle pumps but not quad sets but nothing hurts, I was waiting in a room and feel like I can go out and pee by myself.</description>

      <description>7/11/25 (Friday night) - I can&amp;rsquo;t figure out why I can&amp;rsquo;t finish my tasks in Habitica at this time. I have them all listed but I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why I&amp;rsquo;m not doing it. I figured days later that I&amp;rsquo;ve become fixated on that Twitch thing playing in the background. Sometimes, I get blinded by the things in front of me. Be better than that.&#xA;Drafts - Stop just hovering through the surface, go with the details.</description>

      <description>The installation will be as a container in TrueNAS Scale to centralize media/document storage and processing.&#xA;Paperless-ngx Write in all the passwords, username, email, etc. No need to change anything aside for the Storage Configuration. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to create my own Host Path to easily manage the configurations.&#xA;This installation will also have an android applicatoin called Paperless Mobile. It works well, just add the IP address and port when logging in.</description>

      <description>For this project, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen options between Discord, SMS, and email. I ended up with email as it seems like it&amp;rsquo;s the best for my use case: open industry standard, has been around forever, and isn&amp;rsquo;t going anywhere.&#xA;Problem The guides are only set for Gmail. Why? They already offer a standard SMTP interface. I use ProtonMail - and they don&amp;rsquo;t.&#xA;Fix I&amp;rsquo;ve done my research and here are the options that I found:</description>

      <description>Question This question has popped to my head after looking at my todolist. It goes something like this:&#xA;💅 Cut the nails&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve set this task so that I have a reminder to cut them once they reach a specific length. This has become a problem because I play a lot of basketball and longer nails than usual means something will change in my shot. The chances of it going in will be smaller than usual (not skill issue btw).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m worried about the state of my digital memories and personal data after seeing a lot of people failed by their NAS. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about putting this existing one onto my parents house as an offsite backup and build a new one that I can rack to save space. I thought that was a good idea but at the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s really expensive, so I&amp;rsquo;ve just decided (maybe for the meantime, until I can find another reason to build a new computer LOL) to put the backup in the cloud.</description>

      <description>Hardware I wanted something that would last a long time, the common brands based from my research are HikVision and Dahua. Here are my requirements:&#xA;Supports Frigate High quality - atleast 4mp With POE - so that there are less wires and no more trouble of looking for the nearest power outlet Lightweight - I need it to be as light as possible because I can&amp;rsquo;t drill in my current place so I have to stick it on the ceiling.</description>

      <description>Hardware I have no choice but to buy a new hardware because we moved to a new place, therefore the internet has changed too - for the worse. Just like before, it has the option to configure subnet but it&amp;rsquo;s not working!&#xA;My options were the NanoPI R5S router, Gl.inet stuff, then this one - the Lenovo m720q - the best mini PC that you could get for cheap.&#xA;I chose this one because of the upgradability and aesthetics, and the price difference is also not that high so might as well settle for the one that pleases my eyes the most.</description>

      <description>First posted on: 2021-11-30T00:00:00+08:00&#xA;Introduction Valorant is a free-to play 5 versus 5 FPS (first-person tactical hero shooter) game developed and published by Riot Games on 2020. Simply put, it&amp;rsquo;s like CS:GO but with abilities.&#xA;I played this game because I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to play at that time, the system requirements is pretty low, and my computer can easily handle it. It is not my first FPS game but I can confidently say that it is the first FPS game that I seriously played.</description>

I need to create a blog post about it. The usual league is called WKND(short for weakend since it only happens every weekend) League. This one that I&amp;rsquo;m commissioning is the shorter and older(35 yo and up only) version of the league.</description>

      <description>This post has been paused for the meantime due to priorities.&#xA;I was looking for a lightweight operating system to host my dashboard and a few static movies/videos that I can play in the background and I landed on Alpine Linux. But apparently, NVIDIA drivers are hard to install in Alpine so I moved to Debian.&#xA;This VM will passthrough my 1050TI so that I can watch movies, use the browser, and use software that requires hardware transcoding with ease.</description>

A few crucial thing is missing from this like: - excluding the disks from pve, or else you will wonder why it periodically interrupts disk operations or wakes up sleeping disks - disabling the &amp;ldquo;use tablet for pointer&amp;rdquo; as that in itself causes 10+% CPU load on the host side for some reason - disabling &amp;ldquo;hardware&amp;rdquo; acceleration of virtIO as this is known to cause problems - doing smart configuration (like APM, idle times) on the host side as the guest won&amp;rsquo;t have access to smart data and alerts - optionally moving the system dataset to the boot disk</description>

      <description>Introduction I started this homelab journey because I already exhausted my 1 TB external SSD. I looked for options and I found NAS as the best one. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to justify buying/creating a server for years, it will help with upskilling they (I) said, but that reason is just not enough. Cloud options are always available and some are also free. But now that I have a NAS requirement, I figured that relying in the cloud for storage will really be costly.</description>

      <description>Threat Modeling, The What, Why, Who And When What Is Threat Modeling Threat Modeling is a process of systematically listing all potential ways one can attack an application.&#xA;Systematic approach - repeatable and consistent process during the whole development lifecycle Looking at attacks - actively looking at what can be abused Probable threat scenarios - list of threats Definitions Weakness - software defect, bug Vulnerability - weakness that can be exploited Attack/Incident - target, attack vector, threat actor Attack surface - anything that can be obtained, used, or attacked by a threat actor Risk = Impact * Likelihood Why Should One Perform Threat Modeling Pro-active approach - security upfront Efficient - the sooner a bug or a vulnerability is discovered in the SDLC, the cheaper it is Prioritize bugs - the outcome is the list of potential threats and/or risks of the application, which is used to determine further mitigation strategies that will allow to prioritize the workload Better understanding - will give the developers a whole overview of the system The ultimate objective of threat modeling is risk reduction.</description>

      <description>For many of us that works in Information Security, many of us sees risk as a negative thing. But risk is an essential part of a business. From ISO/IEC 31000 - Risk is the effect of uncertainty on an objective. An effect is a deviation from the expected - positive and/negative.&#xA;Risk Standards ISO/IEC 31000 - Risk Management Principles and Guideline ISO/IEC 27005 - Information Technology - Security Techniques - Information Security Risk Management NIST SP800-39 - Managing Information Security Risk COBIT 5 for Risk NIST SP800-30 Rev 1 - Guide for Conducting Risk Assessment HTRA - Harmonized Threat and Risk Assessment Risk Management begins with: Knowing what has to be protected Identification of assets Determining asset value Understanding risk culture of the organization Risk acceptance Risk tolerance Risk Relative to Information Security Management Information Security Risk is a potential that a given threat will exploit vulnerabilities of an asset or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization.</description>

      <description>When we were young, there are times in our studies where there are topics or lessons that our brain can&amp;rsquo;t comprehend. In this blog, I will discuss what I learned reviewing the really important topic - The Philippine Government. I learned that it is all based on the Philippine Constitution.&#xA;The Philippine Government (Filipino: Pamahalaan ng Pilipinas) is the national government of the Philippines. It is governed as unitary state under a presidential representative and democratic and a constitutional republic where the President function as both the head of state and the head of government of the country within a multiform multi-party system.</description>
