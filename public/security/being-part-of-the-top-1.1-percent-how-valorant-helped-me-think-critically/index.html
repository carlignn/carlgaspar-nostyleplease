    <h1>Being Part of the Top 1.1% - How Valorant Helped Me Think Critically</h1>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Valorant is a free-to play 5 versus 5 FPS (first-person tactical hero shooter) game developed and published by Riot Games on 2020. Simply put, it&rsquo;s like CS:GO but with abilities.</p>
<p>I played this game because I don&rsquo;t have anything to play at that time, the system requirements is pretty low, and my computer can easily handle it. It is not my first FPS game but I can confidently say that it is the first FPS game that I seriously played.</p>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p>6 months from now, I started playing Valorant (June 2021), and today I reached Immortal 1. Now I&rsquo;m part of the top 1.1% of players playing the game.</p>
<p>I got hooked because of the satisfying head-shot sounds in-game.</p>
<h3 id="my-progress">My Progress</h3>
<p>Here are the Valorant Ranks: (If you don&rsquo;t care about the game, move forward.)</p>
<p><img src="/img/Valorant%20Ranks.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Experience (PUT EXPERIENCE WITH TEAMMATES, PUT AGENTS USE ON EVERY MAP, ALSO TWITCH STREAMERS)</p>
<ul>
<li>Iron 1-2 -  Pick Reyna, buy Odin, use ult, GG.</li>
<li>Iron 3 - Started watching YouTube videos about how to play <strong>THE GAME</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Played Aim Labs training</li>
<li>At this time, I understand that it is possible to tap people heads and not just body shot them</li>
<li>Got impatient and always getting tilted and got back to Odin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bronze - Gold 1 - Went so fast (Yes, I reached Gold 1 with Odin).
<ul>
<li>Hard-stuck at Gold 1, always getting 1 tapped by the enemy</li>
<li>Got back to my ass and started trying to hit heads with the Vandal</li>
<li>Started hitting heads but still stuck at Gold 1</li>
<li>Got back to YouTube and learn the mechanics, I found out that you need to also move to avoid the enemy bullets. Learned counter strafing and different kinds of peeking which is also part of the mechanics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gold 3 - I don&rsquo;t know how did I get here but I&rsquo;m having a hard time getting to Platinum.
<ul>
<li>Learned about the 3 most important things in the game, mechanics, game sense and communication. These things apply in real life as well
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanics</strong> - Understanding the mechanics of the game
<ul>
<li>Easy - I shoot people - they die - we win
<ul>
<li>Plant the bomb - it explodes - we win</li>
<li>Enemy planted the bomb - I defuse it - we win</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Medium - Each character has their own skills - use it to make the easy mechanics easier to achieve
<ul>
<li>Use smoke - enemy could be on the other side of the smoke - people won&rsquo;t cross</li>
<li>Use flash - enemy blind - enemy can&rsquo;t shoot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hard - Shoot them in the head - don&rsquo;t just shoot them anywhere - <strong>shoot them in their head</strong>
<ul>
<li>Move after or before shooting - enemy will find it hard to hit</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Game Sense</strong> - Now that I&rsquo;ve understand the game mechanics it&rsquo;s now easier for me to deduce what&rsquo;s going on.
<ul>
<li>Easy - Enemy not in A - they&rsquo;re probably in B
<ul>
<li>Use abilities to figure out where the enemies are</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Medium - There are 3 people in A - there&rsquo;s probably 2 people in B
<ul>
<li>Enemy used all their smokes - they don&rsquo;t have smokes now</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hard - We got B site but the 3 people in A hasn&rsquo;t helped them yet - they&rsquo;re probably in flank
<ul>
<li>Abilities have cool downs - how long until the next ability can be used</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - Talk to team - try to understand each teammates personality - mute if necessary
<ul>
<li>Easy - Talk to team</li>
<li>Medium - Talk to team</li>
<li>Hard - Talk to team</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Watched Twitch streamers (specially <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sinatraa">sinatraa</a> - clearing angles, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/zombs">zombs</a> - different way to play the game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@noted">noted</a> - counter strafing)</li>
<li>Learned double counter strafing, where I strafe, shoot; strafe, shoot; strafe, crouch, spray</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Platinum 3 - Hard stuck. I understand the game sense and communication properly, but always inconsistent with the mechanics. Always getting 1 tapped.
<ul>
<li>No cover, always picking the losing angle, always ending up in the middle of the field</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have to always make flashy plays</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Diamond 1-Immortal - This is just a matter of time once I got the mechanics, game sense, and communication figured out.</li>
<li>Immortal-Radiant - Hitting the Radiant rank will require so much time and effort. I don&rsquo;t have those things so I gave up. I just want to prove to myself that I now finally understand the game.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>The higher your rank is, the more toxic, prideful, and troll the most players will be.</li>
<li>Everything in life has its mechanics.</li>
<li>When you know the mechanics you&rsquo;ll understand the game better.</li>
<li>When I developed my game sense, I learned how to critically think in real life. Apparently, game sense is just common sense applied in a game.</li>
<li>I started playing CS:GO again and the mechanics is the same.</li>
<li>I started playing DotA 2 again and started owning.</li>
<li>Mechanics also applies on how to live your own life. The way I live my life now is very different because of playing this game. I learned that almost everything has it&rsquo;s own pattern. I&rsquo;m now always trying to be conscious living my everyday life instead of living the ordinary repetitive unconscious life. I&rsquo;ve got the sense of critical thinking.</li>
<li>Gears matter, too:
<ul>
<li>140hz ASUS Monitor</li>
<li>Anne Pro 2 Keyboard - Not really a ground breaking keyboard, it just feels premium, like something has changed.</li>
<li>Logitech Mouse - How you hold a mouse and grip it matters as well, me personally uses fingertip grip.
<ul>
<li>Settings - EDPI 312, 2400 - 0.13, 2000 - 0.156, 800 - 0.39</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Food I eat</li>
<li>Addiction</li>
<li>The progress made it easier because of solving the problem part</li>
</ul>
