</ul>
<h4 id="risk-mitigation--steps-1-and-2">Risk Mitigation – Steps 1 and 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Prioritize Actions
<ul>
<li>Based on risk levels presented in the risk assessment report, implementation actions are prioritized.</li>
<li>Top priority should be given to highest risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step 2: Evaluate Recommended Control Options
<ul>
<li>Feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk mitigation) of the recommended control options are analyzed.</li>
<li>Objective is to select the most appropriate control option for minimizing risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="risk-mitigation--steps-3-4-and-5">Risk Mitigation – Steps 3, 4, and 5</h4>

<li>Usually a trade-off between security and business operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step 4: Select Controls
<ul>
<li>On the basis of the results of the cost-benefit analysis, management determines the most cost-effective control(s) for reducing risk to the organization’s mission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step 5: Assign Responsibility
<ul>
<li>Appropriate persons (in-house personnel or external contracting staff) who have the appropriate expertise and skill-sets to implement the selected controls are identified and responsibility is assigned.</li>

<h4 id="risk-mitigation--steps-6-and-7">Risk Mitigation – Steps 6 and 7</h4>
<ul>
<li>Step 6: Develop a Safeguard Implementation Plan

<li>Lists of responsible teams and staff</li>
<li>Start date for implementation</li>
<li>Target completion date for implementation</li>

<h4 id="evaluation-and-assessment">Evaluation and Assessment</h4>
<ul>
<li>As business operations or technologies change, periodic reviews must be conducted to
<ul>
<li>Analyze changes</li>
<li>Account for new threats and vulnerabilities created by changes</li>
<li>Determine effectiveness of existing controls</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continuous evaluation and assessment of risks is an important component of the risk management life cycle.</li>
