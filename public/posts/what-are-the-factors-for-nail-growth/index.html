    <h2 id="question">Question</h2>
<p>This question has popped to my head after looking at my todolist. It goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ðŸ’… Cut the nails</p></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set this task so that I have a reminder to cut them once they reach a specific length. This has become a problem because I play a lot of basketball and longer nails than usual means something will change in my shot. The chances of it going in will be smaller than usual (not skill issue btw).</p>
<p>This is only the third time this task has popped up:</p>
<ul>
<li>First was when I initiated it.</li>
<li>Second was the testing stage, how long did it take me to realize that my nails are long from the time that I initiated this task?</li>
<li>Third time is now.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the second time, it took me 8 days to decide that I&rsquo;d need to cut it. So I set the next task to remind me after 8 days. But it&rsquo;s already been 10 days since the second coming and the nails are still aren&rsquo;t ready. What is happening?</p>
<h2 id="factors">Factors</h2>
<p>From my research, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seasonal change - slower in colder months
<ul>
<li>Well, it&rsquo;s definitely became colder these days</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changes in activity - if youâ€™re typing/handling things less, growth may slow
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t think so, I&rsquo;ve been typing a lot for the past week now</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dietary/health fluctuations
<ul>
<li>Maybe? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve eaten something healthy lately. Few exercises every day but no cardio where I really worked myself up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Natural variation - nail growth isnâ€™t perfectly consistent week to week</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking, I&rsquo;m not living a healthy life this last 10 days. I have to get up and do my thing. It&rsquo;s a good thing that I got curious, and I have this todo app with a reminder. I&rsquo;ve been noticing a lot of little things lately that shows how is my health doing. In before, I will just wait for my nails to be at the perfect length before cutting it, now I&rsquo;m more conscious.</p>
<h2 id="correction">Correction</h2>
<p>ChatGPT said that it&rsquo;s not a reliable short-term health indicator. It may be placebo but I&rsquo;m framing it as it helped me to look back and remember what I&rsquo;ve been doing over the past few days.</p>
