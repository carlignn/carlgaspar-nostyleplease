    <p>This is from my Twitter post back in 24/04/25</p>

    <p>I DID IT! Finally reached Divine rank (4600 mmr) in DotA 2! I just want to prove to myself that I understand the mechanics of the game and I&rsquo;m still capable of solving problems. I&rsquo;ve been playing this game on and off even before my age reached double digits.</p>
<p>First I tried to reach 3000 mmr (tiered rank does not exist yet at that time) from 2000 mmr then I stopped for 8 years. Tried again to reach 4000 mmr and finally, I&rsquo;m here!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll try Immortal next but the journey is super awful for me. I only had pizza for meals and did not took a bath (longest streak) for the last 3 days. Filthy. A lot of grievers, too since I&rsquo;m playing late at night where everyone&rsquo;s unhinged and queues pre-tilted.</p>
<p>One of the few things I&rsquo;ve learned is the community is ultra toxic, a little bit of mishap can cause everyone the game. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to play at higher ranks on any game to enjoy it more since everyone knows the mechanics there..</p>
<p>..but boy was I wrong, the attitude of players is the same all throughout the ranks. The ego is so high because of knowing nothing and the thought of knowing everything.</p>
<p>The game is very complex it took me 10+ years to understand it. I&rsquo;d say I had a lot of fun learning the game, items, and hero mechanics. I learned a lot in comparison to team or social skills. The game is too old that the players still doesn&rsquo;t know the existence of microphones.</p>
<p>Same thing I did with Valorant when I reached Immortal, I&rsquo;ll stop playing and continue living the life outside, continue to look for new challenges, puzzles, and problems to solve. It&rsquo;s time to go out and touch some grass.</p>
