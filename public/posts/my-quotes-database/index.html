<li><em>Undated</em> - James Clear on life. I really like this quote.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Many of the best things in life are endless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being in a great relationship. Staying fit and healthy. Doing work that fulfills you. Being a good parent, coach, or teacher.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stop worrying about accomplishing these things and instead focus on building a life where you continually practice them.</p>

<li><em>Undated</em> - James Clear on how to optimize doing what you love.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Brainstorm some answers to these questions:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Which activity makes you the most money per minute?</li>
<li>Which activity delivers the most excitement per minute?</li>
<li>Which activity creates the most connection per minute?</li>
<li>Which activity provides you the most laughter per minute?</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Undated</em> - James Clear on communication.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“One easy way to show you care about others is to ask them questions about their life.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>What are they excited about?</li>
<li>What are they working on?</li>
<li>What are they hoping for?</li>
</ul>

<p>Simply asking the question and listening thoughtfully is an act of generosity. You&rsquo;re giving them the gift of attention.”</p>

<li><em>Undated</em> - Shane Parrish on doing more things after work.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Mandatory work earns you a living. Voluntary work earns you a future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The work you do during regular hours earns you a paycheck, but it’s what you do (or don’t do) outside of those hours that earns you opportunity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ve seen many people fight this insight, and almost none of them win.</p>

<li><em>Undated</em> - James Clear on bouncing out of frustration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Earlier this week I <a href="https://x.com/wizofecom/status/1998391469934030880">​read a line​</a> that stood out to me, “Your goal in life should be to reduce the amount of time it takes you to get out of a bad state.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ability to bounce back quickly is a key skill in life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My wife once told me, “When you&rsquo;re five, you can be mad for a day. When you&rsquo;re ten, you can be mad for an hour. By the time you&rsquo;re thirty, you get ten minutes—and then you have to move on.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Life is full of moments of frustration and disappointment. Growth and maturity is learning to pull yourself out of a bad state faster.”</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>High Agency</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;It’s roughly the ability to solve problems by believing they&rsquo;re not unsolvable if they don&rsquo;t defy physics. Or: A sense that the story given to you by other people about what you can/cannot do is just that - a story.&rdquo;</p>
