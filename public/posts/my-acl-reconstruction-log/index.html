First time shooting the ball in the court, I missed doing it but it still feels weird.

I just don&rsquo;t want to overdo it, I don&rsquo;t want to tear it again, I&rsquo;m not sure if it will tear but I&rsquo;d need proper guidance. I&rsquo;ve been walking with a crutch outside but I&rsquo;m consciously just using it as a backup just in case I slip or feel like falling down. I&rsquo;m just lifting it up and not putting any force down, just like walking but with something in my hand. I&rsquo;m just not comfortable walking without it outside. Inside our house is different. I&rsquo;ve been walking around without crutch and it&rsquo;s good so far. I noticed that I can&rsquo;t flex my leg backwards while standing, something on top of the gastrocnemius is restricting the full range by itself. I need to ask my PT this.</td>
