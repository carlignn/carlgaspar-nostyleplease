    <p>I played as the announcer on our basketball rec league and it&#39;s fucking amazing! That&#39;s the first time for me and I want more!</p>

    <hr>
<p>About a month ago, I had my ACL reconstructed and will not be able to play basketball for a year. I don&rsquo;t want to just not do anything and standby, so I&rsquo;ve decided to volunteer as the commissioner on the next league, and so that the owner of the league - the original commissioner can play the game.</p>
<h3 id="broken-shotclock">Broken Shotclock</h3>
<p>As the commissioner, aside from managing things, in the court - I am the camera man. I film the game and coordinate with the scorer and the timer. But this time, our shotclock is broken, someone has to track it and take the mic and announce the time.</p>
<p>The league is at the end of the first round robin and the game will be against the only undefeated teams which made it more exciting. At first, I&rsquo;m just announcing the time, then I got used to talking to the mic, I&rsquo;ve started adding things (e.g. timeout, substitution, foul, hyped shots, and player surnames).</p>
<p>It was a really fun experience and I want more! Having the ability to add more emotions to the game feels like a really important task. Making it more enjoyable for the players, audiences, and everyone involved. This is the funnest off-season for me so far. On to the next! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVoYdzdXd4Y">THE GAME</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wkndbasketball">REC LEAGUE</a></p>
