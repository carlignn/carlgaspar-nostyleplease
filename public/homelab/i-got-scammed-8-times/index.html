    <p>I&rsquo;ve got failing SSDs for a year now since I started my <a href="/homelab">HOMELAB</a> journey. It is all a Samsung 870 EVO 1TB SSD. I&rsquo;ve bought 8 in total - 5 have failed and 3 more waiting for their demise.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z0u2Yn2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I was blaming my Windows installation since it&rsquo;s too heavy than the linux installations that I&rsquo;ve been doing so far. I never tried to install Windows again because of that. Then when I was trying to passthrough my GPU, then whatever homelab stuff that I&rsquo;ve been doing. Probably due to too much read and write on the disk that it failed right away. I never checked what&rsquo;s the current pricing of SSDs. It turns out I was buying it for half the price and I only realized it after the eight time I bought it (yeah, I&rsquo;m stupid). Now that I look at it, it&rsquo;s the same shop delisting and relisting that same SSD.</p>

<p>Look at the inside, what the hell is this?! Ugh! What at an expensive and very long lesson PHP18,910. JESUS! Now that I computed it and see it accumulated, I feel bad for myself. It could have been 2 more Lenovo MiniPC nodes or 3 sturdy and long lasting SSDs! I can feel the counterfeit lighter than the <strong>REAL</strong> SSD.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now switched to Crucial MX500 1TB SSD <a href="https://shopee.ph/Itw-Crucial-500GB-1TB-2TB-SSD-3D-Nand-SATA-2.5-Internal-i.89762129.7835536319">SHOPEE</a>, I have 3 nodes but only bought 2 to check if it&rsquo;s gonna work. Looking good so far, I am able to check the authenticity on their website without opening or plugging in the SSD itself. Hope it lasts!</p>
