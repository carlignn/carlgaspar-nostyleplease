<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p>I was on a 2-year hiatus and my focus went everywhere.</p>
<p>Growth on:</p>
<ul>
<li>self improvement</li>
<li>networking/communication</li>
<li>media</li>
<li>family/friends</li>
<li>emotional quotient</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m back catching up.</p>
<p>I was told to be the commissioner for our next basketball league. I need to create a blog post about it. The usual league is called WKND(short for weakend since it only happens every weekend) League. This one that I&rsquo;m commissioning is the shorter and older(35 yo and up only) version of the league. I think I&rsquo;ll be calling it Sprint Cup S1.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<ul>
<li>One of the best thing that happened this year is <a href="https://habitica.com/">Habitica</a>. It&rsquo;s now has become my bible. I&rsquo;ve made a system that I follow everyday. <strong>This has been my most productive year to date</strong>.</li>
<li>I am now posting almost daily on my social media accounts, it made things easier after I discoverd <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a>. I&rsquo;m using the free tier to post on Facebook, Blue Sky, and Threads, then manually on Twitter (X). I often use scheduled posts to post on peak times and to make sure I don&rsquo;t spam.</li>
<li>I have a scheduled tasks that happened every Tuesday where I go to my Lightroom in iPad and cull/edit the photos that I need to go in my Instagram account. Pair that with <strong>The Martian</strong> audiobook that I&rsquo;m listening to as of the moment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m currently reading She Comes First. It&rsquo;s good! <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/carlignn">TheStoryGraph</a></li>
<li>I finished rereading The Alchemist this year.</li>
<li>I dropped Holding Up the Universe. I was reading it and felt boring, I read the reviews and it looks like it isn&rsquo;t for me.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fitness">Fitness</h2>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m focused on prehabbing the muscles around my knee before my knee surgery - ACL reconstruction on the right.</li>
<li>On the left, there&rsquo;s patellar tendinitis that doesn&rsquo;t need surgery but just needs strenghtening of surrounding muscles.</li>
<li>I found the exercise that worked well for it - <a href="https://www.fix-knee-pain.com/how-to-do-eccentric-squats-for-patellar-tendonitis/">Eccentric Squats</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="homelab">Homelab</h2>
<ul>
<li>I just finised firewall-ing and VPN-ing my homelab. I can now access it from anywhere! NICE! <a href="homelab/my-opnsense-documentation/">OPNSense</a></li>
<li>I&rsquo;m working on notifications as of the moment, so I can receive alerts when something goes wrong.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software-engineering">Software Engineering</h2>
<ul>
<li>Currently just working on this website. I&rsquo;ve migrated from a previous one which looks huge and a lot of things happening. This one is more <strong>MINIMAL</strong>, I like it.</li>
<li>Trying to finish drafts and reviewing some posts that were made by the younger (inexpirienced) me.</li>
<li>This looks kinda finished now, I&rsquo;ve added theming and search, pretty cool!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been drawned to vibe coding lately, Claude Code is super fucking awesome!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="karaoke">Karaoke</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten <strong>SO</strong> interested in making my own karaoke system at home. I&rsquo;m down to the rabbit hole again of audio equipments. Here&rsquo;s what I think so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixer - Yamaha MG10X - this already has a compressor and effects built-in - costs 14k PHP</li>
<li>Mic - Phenyx Pro PTU-71A - the most basic wireless mic, the community said that this is good enough - costs 7k PHP</li>
<li>Speaker - Alto TX410 - this is an active speaker which was good enough for karaoke, I might buy another one if needed in the future - costs 10k PHP</li>
</ul>
<p>I got torned between using pedals for the effects and compressor or just buy the one built-in. But it looks like it&rsquo;s much more complicated for my use case, so I&rsquo;m thinking of just buying the Mixer with those built-in. I&rsquo;ve only bought the speaker so far, just to see if I really want it. <strong>I&rsquo;M SO EXICTED!</strong></p>
<h2 id="media">Media</h2>
<p>I have implemeted this system where when I&rsquo;m consuming media, you can only consume an episode a day. Watching all of it at once is making me desensitized, <strong>unproductive</strong>, or depressed because there&rsquo;s no more new seasons or episodes. One system for binging, where I can put my brain into relax mode - this mode is really bad, don&rsquo;t just do it if you have more important tasks pending.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve developed a new habit - bad habit, I&rsquo;ve been rating the media that I&rsquo;m consuming when there&rsquo;s still a few minutes left on it. Rating it low thinking that they didn&rsquo;t close it well, leaving me updating my rating and review to a good one after.</p>
<ul>
<li>Savoring - I just finished the Bleach anime and now started the sequels. It is so good it made me just watch one episode a week. I don&rsquo;t want it to end yet without the last season. Savor everything and the feels will keep going!</li>
<li>Binging - I started rewatching the Proxy-Pass anime. I know I&rsquo;ve watched it before I just forgot what happened, I need to remember so I can score it again. So far, it&rsquo;s 10/10. <a href="https://anilist.co/user/carlignn/">Anilist</a></li>
<li>Binging(2) - Another one is the Juvenile Justice korean drama. I saw people watching this on Discord channel named Movie Marathon and decided to join. I was bummed that how could a media be good but give us only <strong>the movie</strong>. Well, I&rsquo;ve never been glad that I was wrong. It is a <em>series</em>, WOOO! <a href="https://letterboxd.com/carlignn/">Letterboxd</a>. I just found out that there&rsquo;s a dedicated site for tracking korean dramas, I created one <a href="https://mydramalist.com/profile/carlignn">MyDramaList</a></li>
<li>Movie - on a weekend to keep my emotions under control. I don&rsquo;t want it to be forgotten.</li>
<li>Completed - Toradora - I just watched it for the nostalgia, and the nostalgia got me. <a href="https://anilist.co/activity/945410280">Review</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>
<p>My partner asked me to find a good console for her father, we only thought of Nintendo Switch back then but it&rsquo;s super expensive, I remember this one time on my rehab - a kid was playing games on a handheld. I asked his mother where&rsquo;d they get that and she said it&rsquo;s her husband that bought that. I searched for that console and now I&rsquo;m on a rabbit hole of which console should I get while maximizing what I already have, and <strong>ROMS</strong>! Oh roms, I&rsquo;m stuck with downloading everything or just keeping what the bests. I ended up keeping all the roms with the low sizes from their consoles and just got the 100 best games from each console that has too big rom file size.</p>
<p>It took me days to find the proper roms, machine, and console, check out <a href="/posts/my-retro-gaming-setup">My Retro Gaming Setup</a>, <a href="my-rom-commit-list">My Rom Commit List</a>, and <a href="my-retrobat-documentation">My Retrobat Documentation</a>. It went from looking for console for her father to looking for the one for me LOL.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really addicted to Mario Kart and Mario Party. They&rsquo;re really well made, really entertaining, and most important is you can play it with friends. AMAZING!</p>
<h2 id="gaming-2">Gaming (2)</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been heavy into simracing these days. I&rsquo;ve bought the gears and subscribed to iRacing. I forgot what it&rsquo;s called but it&rsquo;s like when someone is a newbie into a new hobby and decided to buy all the stuff without thinking much about it. What do I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steering wheel - Moza ES Formula Wheel Mod</li>
<li>Wheel base - Moza DD R5</li>
<li>Pedal - SR-P Lite w Performance Kit w Alien Mods Load-Cell Kit</li>
<li>Wheel Stand - Next Level Racing 2.0</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: F1 2025 Season has ended and the regulations for the cars will change next year. There&rsquo;s already available car for purchase but I don&rsquo;t want to buy it yet until it&rsquo;s verified to be as accurate as the regulations said it&rsquo;d be. I guess let&rsquo;s wait for the season to start!</p>
