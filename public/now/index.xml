      <description>Okay, so here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s up.&#xA;I was on a 2-year hiatus and my focus went everywhere.&#xA;Growth on:&#xA;self improvement networking/communication media family/friends emotional quotient Now I&amp;rsquo;m back catching up.&#xA;I was told to be the commissioner for our next basketball league. I need to create a blog post about it. The usual league is called WKND(short for weakend since it only happens every weekend) League. This one that I&amp;rsquo;m commissioning is the shorter and older(35 yo and up only) version of the league.</description>
