I was on my bed ready to go to sleep and thinking of my blog posts in this website. I want to edit some post but I can't unless I -

1. Go back in front of my computer again and let go of the thought of falling asleep
2. Open TinaCMS just for it to break everything again (some elements are using goldmark renders which can break the posts if updated in rich-text editor)
  * Only to find out that I haven't pushed from my computer - the code in production is not the latest
  * This still won't do since I need to rearrange some of the directories
3. Have the test environment accessible anywhere



* overseerr - request manager
* plex - media manager
* prowlarr - indexer (for radarr and sonarr)
* qbittorrent - torrent client
* radarr - movie collection manager (connects to qbt)
* sonarr - tv show collection manager (connects to qbt)
