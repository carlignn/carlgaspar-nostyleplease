Yeah, this is not it. You're telling me I need to have my cookies in it to be able to archive a private post? That's too much work. I wish there's a way around it. For the meantime, I'll just save my websites on a bookmark and on to the app itself (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.)

This definitely looks better than Karakeep but there's no folder management. Therefore, this is not the solution for me just like PaperlessNGX. I'm better off with the manual approach than trying to complicate it.
