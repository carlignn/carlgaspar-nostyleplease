`nslookup` is a command-line tool used for testing and troubleshooting DNS servers. Basically, just as its name says, it will lookup for the name server of any domain.

`nslookup` can be used in two modes: interactive and non-interactive. To initiate interactive mode, type the command name only: `nslookup`
