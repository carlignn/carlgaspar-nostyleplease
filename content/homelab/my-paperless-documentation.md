The installation will be as a container in TrueNAS Scale to centralize media/document storage and processing.

## Paperless-ngx

Write in all the passwords, username, email, etc. No need to change anything aside for the **Storage Configuration**. I've decided to create my own Host Path to easily manage the configurations.

This installation will also have an android applicatoin called [Paperless Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.astubenbord.paperless_mobile&hl=en-US). It works well, just add the IP address and port when logging in. 

## Paperless AI

One of the prerequisites is having an AI API which I currently don't have, shutting the container off for the meantime.
