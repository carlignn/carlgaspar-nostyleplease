I've got failing SSDs for a year now since I started my [HOMELAB](/homelab) journey. It is all a Samsung 870 EVO 1TB SSD. I've bought 8 in total - 5 have failed and 3 more waiting for their demise.

I was blaming my Windows installation since it's too heavy than the linux installations that I've been doing so far. I never tried to install Windows again because of that. Then when I was trying to passthrough my GPU, then whatever homelab stuff that I've been doing. Probably due to too much read and write on the disk that it failed right away. I never checked what's the current pricing of SSDs. It turns out I was buying it for half the price and I only realized it after the eight time I bought it (yeah, I'm stupid). Now that I look at it, it's the same shop delisting and relisting that same SSD.

Look at the inside, what the hell is this?! Ugh! What at an expensive and very long lesson PHP18,910. JESUS! Now that I computed it and see it accumulated, I feel bad for myself. It could have been 2 more Lenovo MiniPC nodes or 3 sturdy and long lasting SSDs! I can feel the counterfeit lighter than the **REAL** SSD.

I've now switched to Crucial MX500 1TB SSD [SHOPEE](https://shopee.ph/Itw-Crucial-500GB-1TB-2TB-SSD-3D-Nand-SATA-2.5-Internal-i.89762129.7835536319), I have 3 nodes but only bought 2 to check if it's gonna work. Looking good so far, I am able to check the authenticity on their website without opening or plugging in the SSD itself. Hope it lasts!
