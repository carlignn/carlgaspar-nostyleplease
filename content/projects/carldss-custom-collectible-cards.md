##

I've created Carldss as a token/reward for the basketball players of our [rec league](/posts/i-was-an-announcer-today). It's a custom designed card with the players' information, stats, the league, and player image.

I'm hoping to include more leagues and improve my network. Reach out to me in my [SOCIALS](/socials) if you want one.
