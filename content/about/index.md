I'm Carl — a cybersecurity specialist and developer based in the Philippines.

I work in security by day. I'm constantly coding — building my homelab, working on [carldss](https://carldss.com), and automating everything I can. This blog is where I document what I learn — mostly for future me, but maybe it helps you too.

**What you'll find here:** security blogs, homelab guides and best practices, basketball league updates, and random notes on life.

**Outside of work:**
- Basketball trainer & league commissioner (WKND G League - S1, S2)
- Gaming (moba, simracing, FPS, emulation)
- Photography, videography & media (streaming, content creation)
- Reading, cooking, karaoke, fitness
