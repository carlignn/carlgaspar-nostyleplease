## Introduction

Valorant is a free-to play 5 versus 5 FPS (first-person tactical hero shooter) game developed and published by Riot Games on 2020. Simply put, it's like CS:GO but with abilities.

I played this game because I don't have anything to play at that time, the system requirements is pretty low, and my computer can easily handle it. It is not my first FPS game but I can confidently say that it is the first FPS game that I seriously played.

## Experience

6 months from now, I started playing Valorant (June 2021), and today I reached Immortal 1. Now I'm part of the top 1.1% of players playing the game.

I got hooked because of the satisfying head-shot sound of the game. I wouldn't even say "hooked", I'd say I was addicted. Just like any other thing in life, I subconsciously went after that satisfaction/dopamine. I have to note that I was supposed to study and review for my certification but I can't, I can't stop playing.

### My Progress

Here are the Valorant Ranks: (If you don't care about the game, move forward.)

Experience (PUT EXPERIENCE WITH TEAMMATES, PUT AGENTS USE ON EVERY MAP, ALSO TWITCH STREAMERS)

* Iron 1 - Iron 2 -  Pick Reyna, buy Odin, use ult, GG.
* Iron 3 - I started watching YouTube videos about how to play **THE GAME**.
  * Played Aim Labs training
  * At this time, I understand that it is possible to tap people heads and not just shoot their body
  * I always get impatient and tilted and went back to Odin
* Bronze 1 - Gold 1 - Went so fast (Yes, I reached Gold 1 with Odin).
  * Hard-stuck at Gold 1, always getting 1 tapped by the enemy
  * Got back to my ass and started trying to hit heads with the Vandal
  * Started hitting heads but still stuck at Gold 1
  * Got back to YouTube and learn the mechanics, I found out that you need to also move to avoid the enemy bullets. Learned **COUNTER STRAFING** and different kinds of peeking which is also part of the mechanics
* Gold 3 - I don't know how did I got here but I'm having a hard time getting to Platinum.
  * Learned about the 3 of the most important things in the game, **MECHANICS**, **GAME SENSE** and **COMMUNICATION**. These things apply in real life as well
    * **MECHANICS** - Understanding the mechanics of the game
      * Easy
        * I shoot people - we win
        * Plant the bomb - it explodes - we win
        * Enemy planted the bomb - I defuse it - we win
      * Medium
        * Each character has their own skills - use it to make the easy mechanics easier
        * Utilities - use smoke - enemy could be on the other side of the smoke - people will wait until the smoke is cleared - there are more people on our side - we win
        * Use flash - enemy blind - enemy can't shoot - I can shoot - we win
      * Hard
        * Shoot them in the head - don't just shoot them anywhere - **SHOOT THEM ON THEIR HEAD** - we win
        * Move after or before shooting - enemy will find it hard to hit - I hit them - we win
    * **GAME SENSE** - Now that I've understand the game mechanics it's now easier for me to deduce what's going on.
      * Easy
        * Enemy not in A - must be in B
        * Use abilities to figure out where the enemies are - not in B? must be anywhere but in B
      * Medium
        * There are 3 people in A - there's probably 2 people in B
        * Enemy used all their smokes - they don't have smokes now - same goes for flashes
      * Hard
        * We got B site but the 3 people in A hasn't helped them yet - they could be on our flank
        * Abilities have cooldowns - how long until the next ability can be used?
    * **COMMUNICATION** - Talk to team - try to understand each teammates personality - mute if necessary
      * Easy - Talk to team
      * Medium - Talk to team
      * Hard - Talk to team
  * I started watching streamers (especially [sinatraa](https://www.twitch.tv/sinatraa) - taught me how to better clear angles, [zombs](https://www.twitch.tv/zombs) - different way to play the game, [noted](https://www.youtube.com/@noted) - counter strafing)
  * Learned double counter strafing, where I strafe, shoot; strafe, shoot; strafe, crouch, spray
* Platinum 3 - Hard stuck. I understand the game sense and communication properly, but I'm inconsistent with the mechanics. I'm always getting 1 tapped.
  * No cover, always picking the losing angle, always ending up in the middle of the field
  * I thought I always need to make flashy plays, being simple is good
* Diamond 1 - Immortal - This is just a matter of time once I've got the mechanics, game sense, and communication figured out.
* Immortal - Radiant - Hitting the Radiant rank will require so much time and effort. I don't have those things so I stopped. The diminishing returns in terms of skill is really steep. The goal of playing was just to prove to myself that I now finally understand the game.

## Takeaways

* The higher your rank is, the more toxic, prideful, and troll the most players will be.
* When you know the mechanics (the how) you'll understand the thing better.
* When I developed my game sense, I learned how to critically think in real life. Apparently, game sense is just common sense applied in a game.
* I started playing CS:GO again and the mechanics is the same.
* I started playing DotA 2 again and started owning. Not the same mechanics but it has its own mechanics that I've learned.
* Everything in life has its own mechanics.
* Mechanics also applies on how to live your life. The way I am living my life now is very different because of playing this game. I learned that almost everything has it's own pattern. I'm now always trying to be conscious living my everyday life instead of living the ordinary repetitive unconscious life. I've got the sense of critical thinking.
* The progress made it easier because of solving the problem part
* Gears matter, too:
  * 140hz ASUS Monitor
  * Anne Pro 2 Keyboard - Not really a ground breaking keyboard, it just feels premium, like something has changed - *placebo*.
  * Logitech Mouse - How you hold a mouse and grip it matters as well, me personally uses fingertip grip.
    * Settings - EDPI 312, 2400 - 0.13, 2000 - 0.156, 800 - 0.39

***

* It's now August 2025 and I'm just now completing this blog (the procrastinator, I know). I'm rereading how this game has changed my life. I know I can write more regarding this and update it to tell a better story but there's so much thing going on in my life right now that I need to keep moving forward *faster*. I'm not worried though, this lesson that I've learned will continue with me and will also be part of future blog posts. 
* Few more things I've learned since drafting this blog:
  * The food I eat matters too - it's an esports game - sports. Just like an athlete, you need to eat healthy foods and **TIMELY**. If you're hungry and nutrition deficient, it's impossible to play at your highest capacity. I forgot about eating on tie because the game became an addition for me.
  * Addiction - I learned that I need to **ALWAYS** look out of the box. That I'd need to see myself on a third-person view. Heck, even fourth-person view or even higher. I've learned that journey is more important than the destination. Don't focus too much on the goal or I'll start missing the point. I forgot the literal quote but it's something along those lines LOL.
  * Digital Games - You'll always have the chance to repeat the scenario without putting too much effort. Just hit **RESET** and you're good to go again.
