## Question

This question has popped to my head after looking at my todolist. It goes something like this:

> ðŸ’… Cut the nails

I've set this task so that I have a reminder to cut them once they reach a specific length. This has become a problem because I play a lot of basketball and longer nails than usual means something will change in my shot. The chances of it going in will be smaller than usual (not skill issue btw).

This is only the third time this task has popped up:

* First was when I initiated it.
* Second was the testing stage, how long did it take me to realize that my nails are long from the time that I initiated this task?
* Third time is now.

During the second time, it took me 8 days to decide that I'd need to cut it. So I set the next task to remind me after 8 days. But it's already been 10 days since the second coming and the nails are still aren't ready. What is happening?

## Factors

From my research, here's what I've found:

* Seasonal change - slower in colder months
  * Well, it's definitely became colder these days
* Changes in activity - if youâ€™re typing/handling things less, growth may slow
  * Don't think so, I've been typing a lot for the past week now
* Dietary/health fluctuations
  * Maybe? I don't think I've eaten something healthy lately. Few exercises every day but no cardio where I really worked myself up
* Natural variation - nail growth isnâ€™t perfectly consistent week to week

## Takeaway

Here's what I'm thinking, I'm not living a healthy life this last 10 days. I have to get up and do my thing. It's a good thing that I got curious, and I have this todo app with a reminder. I've been noticing a lot of little things lately that shows how is my health doing. In before, I will just wait for my nails to be at the perfect length before cutting it, now I'm more conscious.

## Correction

ChatGPT said that it's not a reliable short-term health indicator. It may be placebo but I'm framing it as it helped me to look back and remember what I've been doing over the past few days.
