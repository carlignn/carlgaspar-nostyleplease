Retrobat will run on my Personal Computer instead of a separate dedicated machine.

## Roms
All roms will be stored in the NAS.

## Symbolic links
[Symbolic links](https://wiki.retrobat.org/tutorials/symbolic-links) will be used in Retrobat for the roms to connect to the NAS.

## BIOS
Default BIOS will be stored in the NAS. (RetroArch on a different folder).

## Screenscraper
All media about the roms will be stored together with the roms in the NAS.

## Currated List for iPad (RetroArch)
**Top 10 games from classic systems of all time and currated list** - these roms will be stored on a separate folder to be maintained continuously and be used for iPad only to save local space.

## Configs
Folders: emulationstation, emulators, and saves will be backed up manually to the NAS
