|                                    | I am going for prehab to strengthen my muscles prior to operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | W-2      |          |
|                                    | I am now doing all the exercises by myself everyday prior to operation. I followed this guy's guide: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czx6LUnG1cs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czx6LUnG1cs)                                                                                                                         | W-1      |          |
| Surgery day                        | I was put to mild sleep, then after an hour, it's done, good shit! I feel weird that everything is okay, I can do ankle pumps but not quad sets but nothing hurts, I was waiting in a room and feel like I can go out and pee by myself.                                                                                | D0       | 09/09/25 |
|                                    | Ever since I came out of the operating room, I've had my ankle propped to a pillow and my leg straight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | D1       | 09/10/25 |
|                                    | It's now starting to hurt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | D2       | 09/11/25 |
|                                    | TENS finally came! I can now start working my quads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | D3       | 09/12/25 |
| First check up                     | Finally got to talk to my doctor, I've got all the worries out of my head. He's a good doctor and it's the hospital that's fucked me up. They overcharged me and never gave me post-op instructions. That's really an awful experience. Never again to VRP.                                                             | W1/D7    | 09/16/25 |
| A lot of accomplishments today     | &#xD;1\) I can now move around with crutches without much hurting.&#xD; 2\) I can now be by myself without help.&#xD; 3\) I was able to take a bath, change, without help, by myself                                                                                                                                    | D11      | 09/20/25 |
| QUADS                              | I can now flex my quads, FINALLY!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | D13      | 09/22/25 |
| Hematoma?                          | This is not a good day, I didn't sleep well and the upper-inner part of my calves hurt. It's painful to walk with crutches. I've checked ChatGPT and it said that it's blood that's why it's hard and sore. I'm trying to massage it a bit, and I think it's helping.                                                   | W2/D14   | 09/23/25 |
|                                    | I can now be on my side when in bed with a pillow between my legs! I still can't sleep on my side though, it's getting numb.                                                                                                                                                                                            | D15      | 09/24/25 |
| 2nd check up                       | Went to the doctor today and he's removed my stitches. He said it will take about a day for it to completely heal. I should be able to take a bath without leg cover, NICE!                                                                                                                                             | D16      | 09/25/25 |
| First bath without leg cover       | I just got the bandages removed and it feels good. Sometimes I can feel it hurt in the biggest stitch. The doctor said I should be able to take a bath without covering the wound. But I'm not so confident yet, so covering it for today. **NOPE**! I just took a bath without the cover and it's fine. It feels good! | D17      | 09/26/25 |
|                                    | I am trying to force flexion and it bit me in the ass. It's gotten swollen to the point that it's uncomfortable. I've iced and elevated it but it's still there. SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE. I thought everything's okay already. Looks like I have to deal with this for more.                                                |          |          |
|                                    | I'm trying to not take my pain reliever as much as I can. I thought I can handle the pain but it's still getting on to me. I'm trying to preserve it just in case I need it in the future. I might need to ask my doctor if I can buy more.                                                                             | D18      | 09/27/25 |
|                                    | The area around my knee is still swollen but now manageable. I guess I'll stop with the flexion for the meantime and just do quad sets with EMS.                                                                                                                                                                        |          |          |
| First rehab                        | Feels super good! 123-degree flexion, and almost a full extension, LFG! I think it's not a full extension yet because when my leg felt super numb a few days ago, I had to flex it for a bit a time. Good results nevertheless!                                                                                         | D20      | 09/29/25 |
| First own rehab                    | I did the rehab by myself. Feels good but I got it a little bit more swollen than when I'm supervised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | W3/D21   | 09/30/25 |
| Really long walk                   | First time going for a really long walk. The convenience store nearby was close so I was forced to go to the next one. First time going up and down the stairs as well, not a lot, but still progress.                                                                                                                  | D23      | 10/02/25 |
| Second rehab                       | I've improved my extension again and flexion from 123 to 129 degrees. It's also now easier to walk with one crutch.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | D24      | 10/03/25 |
| Single crutcher                    | I can now just use a single crutch! **HUGE**!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | D25      | 10/04/25 |
|  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |          |          |
