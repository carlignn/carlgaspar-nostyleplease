| First bath without leg cover                                   | I just got the bandages removed and it feels good. Sometimes I can feel it hurt in the biggest stitch.

I think it's not a full extension yet because when my leg felt super numb a few days ago, I had to flex it for a bit a time. Good results nevertheless!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | D20      | 09/29/25 |

I need to increase the bike height next time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | M1-D30   | 10/09/25 |
| Fourth rehab                                                   | 144 flexion out of 150. Extension is at 0 after all the exercises. Same as when I'm at home, I'm having trouble extending fully until it gets warm, like an engine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | D31      | 10/10/25 |

I just looked at the bruise behind my knee and it's still dark. I thought it subside a bit but nothing has changed at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | D32      | 10/11/25 |
| The busiest day                                                | I went commuting by the train to the basketball court then to the mall then to the other mall. This is the farthest I've walked on a single crutch - 4k steps total. I felt confident from time to time to just walk without the crutch. It's the first time I tried walking backwards a bit without crutch. Progress! First time shooting the ball in the court, I missed doing it but it still feels weird. I'm still afraid to dip down and extend my injured leg, resulting to missed shot since only the left leg is working LOL. I managed to make one though, out of 8, I think.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | D33      | 10/12/25 |
| Fifth rehab                                                    | The usual, just with more PTs, they are swarming me! Most importantly, I did all the standing exercises without the crutch, HUGE! We also did one leg balance with a ball, it's the first time I played with the ball like that and it's amazing. I can feel myself going back, I'm so happy!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | W5-D35   | 10/14/25 |
| Back to the gym with the uppers                                | First time doing upper body workout post-op, feels good! What I'm doing are rehabbing my patellar tendinitis on the left leg with isometric leg extension, doing it lightly on the right - but full range of motion (I was only able to do it once LOL), cycling for 20 minutes (variation in strength but trying to maintain 60 rpm), then the upper body workout. I did push today, tomorrow will be pull.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | D36      | 10/15/25 |
| Gastrocnemius restriction                                      | First time doing pull workout. I did the usual left leg isometric and added a few reps on the injured side. I'm so happy I did 12 reps on the lightest weight. I can't even move past halfway yesterday. Huge progress! I just don't want to overdo it, I don't want to tear it again, I'm not sure if it will tear but I'd need proper guidance. I've been walking with a crutch outside but I'm consciously just using it as a backup just in case I slip or feel like falling down. I'm just lifting it up and not putting any force down, just like walking but with something in my hand. I'm just not comfortable walking without it outside. Inside our house is different. I've been walking around without crutch and it's good so far. I noticed that I can't flex my leg backwards while standing, something on top of the gastrocnemius is restricting the full range by itself. I need to ask my PT this. | D37      | 10/16/25 |
