I DID IT! Finally reached Divine rank (4600 mmr) in DotA 2! I just want to prove to myself that I understand the mechanics of the game and I'm still capable of solving problems. I've been playing this game on and off even before my age reached double digits.

First I tried to reach 3000 mmr (tiered rank does not exist yet at that time) from 2000 mmr then I stopped for 8 years. Tried again to reach 4000 mmr and finally, I'm here!

I'm not sure if I'll try Immortal next but the journey is super awful for me. I only had pizza for meals and did not took a bath (longest streak) for the last 3 days. Filthy. A lot of grievers, too since I'm playing late at night where everyone's unhinged and queues pre-tilted.

One of the few things I've learned is the community is ultra toxic, a little bit of mishap can cause everyone the game. I've always wanted to play at higher ranks on any game to enjoy it more since everyone knows the mechanics there..

..but boy was I wrong, the attitude of players is the same all throughout the ranks. The ego is so high because of knowing nothing and the thought of knowing everything.

The game is very complex it took me 10+ years to understand it. I'd say I had a lot of fun learning the game, items, and hero mechanics. I learned a lot in comparison to team or social skills. The game is too old that the players still doesn't know the existence of microphones.

Same thing I did with Valorant when I reached Immortal, I'll stop playing and continue living the life outside, continue to look for new challenges, puzzles, and problems to solve. It's time to go out and touch some grass.
