Habitica

Knee surgery, ACL and patellar tendinitis




I'm currently working on this blogpost. I was on a 2-year hiatus and focused on everything else other than my career.

Growth on:
- self improvement
- networking/communication
- media
- family/friends
- emotional quotient

Now I'm back catching up.
