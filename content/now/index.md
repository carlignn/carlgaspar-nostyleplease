I was on a 2-year hiatus and focused on everything else other than my career.

Growth on:
- self improvement
- networking/communication
- media
- family/friends
- emotional quotient

Now I'm back catching up.


## Productivity

* One of the best thing that happened this year is [Habitica](https://habitica.com/). It's now has become my bible. I've made a system that I follow everyday. **This has been my most productive year to date**.
* I am now posting almost daily on my social media accounts, it made things easier after I discoverd [Buffer](https://buffer.com/). I'm using the free tier to post on Facebook, Blue Sky, and Threads, then manually on Twitter (X). I often use scheduled posts to post on peak times and to make sure I don't spam. 
* I have a scheduled tasks that happened every Tuesday where I go to my Lightroom in iPad and cull/edit the photos that I need to go in my Instagram account. Pair that with **The Martian** audiobook that I'm listening to as of the moment. 

## Books

* I'm currently reading She Comes First. It's good! [TheStoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/carlignn)
* I finished rereading The Alchemist this year.
* I dropped Holding Up the Universe. I was reading it and felt boring, I read the reviews and it looks like it isn't for me.

## Fitness

* I'm focused on prehabbing the muscles around my knee before my knee surgery - ACL reconstruction on the right.
* On the left, there's patellar tendinitis that doesn't need surgery but just needs strenghtening of surrounding muscles.
* I found the exercise that worked well for it - [Eccentric Squats](https://www.fix-knee-pain.com/how-to-do-eccentric-squats-for-patellar-tendonitis/)

## Homelab

* I just finised firewall-ing and VPN-ing my homelab. I can now access it from anywhere! NICE! [OPNSense](homelab/my-opnsense-documentation/)
* I'm working on notifications as of the moment, so I can receive alerts when something goes wrong.

## Software Engineering

* Currently just working with this website. I've migrated from a previous one which looks huge and a lot of things happening. This one is more **MINIMAL**, I like it.
* Trying to finish drafts and reviewing some posts that were made by the younger (inexpirienced) me.

## Media

I have implemeted this system where when I'm consuming media, you can only consume an episode a day. Watching all of it at once is making me desensitized, **unproductive**, or depressed because there's no more new seasons or episodes. One system for binging, where I can put my brain into relax mode - this mode is really bad, don't just do it if you have more important tasks pending.
* Savoring - I just finished the Bleach anime and now started the sequels. It is so good it made me just watch one episode a week. I don't want it to end yet without the last season. Savor everything and the feels will keep going!
* Binging - I started rewatching the Proxy-Pass anime. I know I've watched it before I just forgot what happened, I need to remember so I can score it again. So far, it's 10/10. [Anilist](https://anilist.co/user/carlignn/)
* Binging(2) - Another one is the Juvenile Justice korean drama. I saw people watching this on Discord channel named Movie Marathon and decided to join. I was bummed that how could a media be good but give us only **the movie**. Well, I've never been glad that I was wrong. It is a *series*, WOOO! [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/carlignn/)
* Movie - on a weekend to keep my emotions under control. I don't want it to be forgotten.
* Completed - Toradora - I just watched it for the nostalgia, and the nostalgia got me. [Review](https://anilist.co/activity/945410280)
